# 💟 Contributing
Elysium isn’t just a bot — it’s a community project and a philosophy.
Our goal is to build wellness, reading, and journaling tools that are empowering, gentle, easy to use, and — above all — human-centered. Whether you’re a developer, writer, UX nerd, avid reader, or someone with fresh ideas, your perspective is welcome here.

> You don’t need to code to be a contributor! Contributions come in all shapes and sizes:
- Feature ideas
- Catching typos
- Better button wording
- Clearer or expanded documentation
- Even just asking smart questions that help us clarify confusing systems

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

## 🌱 Ways You Can Contribute
Here’s a breakdown of how you can get involved, and where to go when you’re ready:

### 📝 Help with Documentation
We maintain a GitBook for clear, beginner-friendly docs. You can help by:
- Writing or improving command pages
- Catching typos, awkward phrasing, or incomplete instructions
- Suggesting better layouts, visuals, or onboarding tips
- Even small edits make a big difference!

### 💡 Suggest Features & UX Improvements
:::info
We love thoughtful feature suggestions — whether they’re small usability tweaks or big ideas.
:::

**Where to do this:**
<div className="md-button-column">
<Link className="button btn-gradient" href="https://github.com/asteriasmoons/elysium-bot/discussions/7#discussion-8519373">Enhancement & Design Ideas</Link>
</div>

Use this thread for:
- Brainstorming new features
- UI/UX improvements
- Feedback about command flow
- “Would this be helpful?” conversations

> It’s collaborative! Your idea doesn’t have to be perfect or final. Comment on others’ ideas, too.

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 🐞 Reporting Bugs
:::info
If you run into a bug or weird edge case, let us know!
:::

**Where to do this:**
<div className="md-button-column">
<Link className="button btn-gradient" href="https://github.com/asteriasmoons/elysium-bot/issues/2#issue-3184423055">Bug Report Issue</Link>
</div>

> **Please do NOT open new issues.**

Instead, comment on the pinned bug report thread and include:
- What happened (and what should have happened)
- How to reproduce it (if possible)
- Screenshots or error messages, if relevant
- What command or feature was involved

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 💬 Ask Questions or Get Help
:::info
Not sure how something works? Confused about a command? Want examples?

<Link className="button btn-gradient" href="https://github.com/asteriasmoons/elysium-bot/discussions/6#discussion-8519364">Q & A/Help Using Bot</Link>
</div>

This is a no-judgment space where you can:
- Ask for clarification
- Share tips or tricks
- Request examples
- Get setup help

> Your questions often help shape future documentation!

### 💻 Developer Contributions
If you’re a developer and want to help with code, you’re welcome to submit PRs — especially for:
- Refactoring / cleanup
- Minor feature additions
- Quality-of-life improvements
- Fixing labeled issues (help wanted, good first issue)

**Local Setup (basic):**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/elysium-bot.git
cd elysium-bot
npm install
# Add your .env file
npm run dev
```
