# 💟 Contributing

Pandoryx isn’t just a bot — it’s a philosophy.
This project is about building server tools that are powerful without being overwhelming, easy to use without sacrificing flexibility, and — above all — human-centered. Whether you're a developer, writer, UX nerd, or someone who just has a great idea for making things smoother, your perspective is welcome here.

You don’t need to know how to code to be a contributor. Contributions come in all shapes: feature ideas, typo catches, better button wording, new docs, or simply asking smart questions that help us clarify confusing systems.

## 🌱 What We're Looking For
Here’s a breakdown of how you can participate and where to go when you’re ready:

### 📝 Help with Documentation
We maintain a Docusaurus documentation for clear, beginner-friendly documentation. You can contribute by:
- Writing or polishing individual command pages
- Catching typos, awkward phrasing, or incomplete instructions
- Suggesting better layouts, examples, or visuals
- Making suggestions for better onboarding or quick start guides
- Even small edits make a big difference.

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 💡 Suggest Features & UX Improvements
We encourage thoughtful feature suggestions, whether they’re small usability tweaks or larger ideas.

Where to do this:
<div className="md-button-column">
<Link className="button btn-gradient" href="https://github.com/asteriasmoons/pandoryx-bot/issues/2#issue-3166322020">
<span className="btn-emoji" aria-hidden="true">💡</span>
<span>Feature Requests</span>
</Link>
</div>

#### This discussion thread is the home for:
- Brainstorming new features
- UI/UX improvements
- Feedback about command flow
- “Would this be helpful?” conversations

It’s collaborative — your idea doesn’t have to be perfect or final. Feel free to comment on others' ideas too!

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 🐞 Reporting Bugs
If you run into unexpected behavior, weird edge cases, or broken functionality — we want to know about it.

Where to do this:
<div className="md-button-column">
<Link className="button btn-gradient" href="https://github.com/asteriasmoons/pandoryx-bot/issues/1#issue-3166312503">
<span className="btn-emoji" aria-hidden="true">🐞</span>
<span>Bug Reports</span>
</Link>
</div>

Please **do NOT open new issues.** Instead, **comment** on the pinned bug report thread and include:
- What happened (and what should have happened)
- How to reproduce it (if possible)
- Screenshots or errors, if relevant
- What command or feature was involved

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 💬 Ask Questions or Get Help
Not sure how something works? Confused about a command? Want examples?

Where to do this:
<div className="md-button-column">
<Link className="button btn-gradient" href="https://github.com/asteriasmoons/pandoryx-bot/discussions/6#discussion-8510717">Q & A/Help Using Bot</Link>
</div>

**This is a judgment-free space where you can:**
- Ask for clarification
- Share usage tips
- Request examples
- Get help with setup or behavior questions

Sometimes these questions help shape future docs — so they’re more valuable than you think!

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 💻 Developer Contributions
If you’re a dev and want to get involved with the bot code, you’re welcome to submit PRs — especially for:
- Refactoring / cleaning up logic
- Minor feature additions
- Quality-of-life improvements
- Fixing labeled issues (help wanted, good first issue)

**Local Setup (basic):**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/pandoryx-bot.git
cd pandoryx-bot
npm install
# Add your .env file
npm run dev
```

More complete developer notes and environment variables coming soon in the GitBook Dev section.

### 🧠 Project Values
Before jumping in, here’s what matters most around here:
- Clarity is everything – We prioritize ease of use and clear explanations over complexity
- Low friction, high value – Contributions should reduce effort for the end user, not add more
- Community-first – We care deeply about people being able to use the bot without needing to “figure it out”
- Respectful and direct – We’re chill and cozy, but also focused and serious about quality

If that resonates with you, you’ll fit right in.
