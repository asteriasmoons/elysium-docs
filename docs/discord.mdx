# **Pandoryx & Elysium Official Discord Server**
Our Discord server is more than just a help desk â€” itâ€™s the heart of the Pandoryx and Elysium communities. Here, technical support blends seamlessly with themed community spaces, creating an environment where you can get answers, share ideas, and connect with others who share your interests.

Whether you need guidance setting up features, troubleshooting errors, or exploring advanced configurations, youâ€™ll find real-time assistance from both the development team and experienced community members. Bug reports, feature requests, and changelog updates are all handled here, giving you a direct voice in how the bots evolve.

But support is only part of the story. This is also a gathering place for people who enjoy the unique themes behind both bots. Pandoryx focuses on moderation, automation, and streamlined server management, so we host conversations about community-building strategies, smart automation, and maintaining order without sacrificing engagement. Elysium is built for book lovers, journal keepers, and anyone interested in habits and emotional wellness, so youâ€™ll find cozy spaces for literary discussions, journaling inspiration, and personal growth conversations.

Inside, the layout is designed to keep things intuitive. Each bot has its own clearly marked areas for support, guides, and updates, while shared lounges and themed discussion channels encourage members to mingle across topics. You might troubleshoot a Pandoryx setting one moment and join a book club chat the next.

**Hereâ€™s what you can expect when you join:**
> - **Dedicated support areas** for both bots, with quick, friendly responses.
> - **Community lounges** for casual conversation and off-topic fun.

We foster an atmosphere that is warm, respectful, and inclusive. Whether youâ€™re a server owner learning moderation best practices or a creative sharing your latest writing, your contributions are valued here. We encourage curiosity, kindness, and the exchange of knowledge, believing that strong communities are built when technical support and personal connection coexist in the same space.
