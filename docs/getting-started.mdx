Welcome to Elysium! This guide will walk you through adding the bot to your server, setting up basic features, and getting comfortable with your first few commands.

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

## ✨ What You’ll Need
Before using Elysium, make sure you have:
- A Discord server (where you have Manage Server permissions)
- A love for books, growth, or journaling (optional but highly encouraged 🥰)

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

## ➕ Invite Elysium to Your Server
:::success
Use the button at the top of the page to invite Elysium
:::

Make sure to grant the bot the necessary permissions during the invite flow. It needs:
  - Send Messages
  - Embed Links
  - Use Slash Commands
  - Manage Messages (for reminders and cleanups)
  - Add Reactions (for interactive features)

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

## 🛠️ Initial Setup Tips
After inviting Elysium, here are a few helpful things to do right away:

### 🪞 Set Up Your Profile
Start by introducing yourself to the bot with:
```bash
/profile set <bio> <intention> <affirmation> <current read> <reading goal> <favorite genre> <preferred format> <favorite author>
```
Or use `/profile edit` to add just a few details at a time!

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 📚 Add a Book to Your Inventory
If you’re tracking books globally with others:
```bash
/inventory addbook <book> <author> <goodreads link>
```

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 🌱 Create a Habit
Build a daily or weekly habit tracker:
```bash
/habit add
```
> This will open a button-based modal to get you started.

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 📓 Start a Journal Entry
Get thoughts out of your head and into a safe space:
```bash
/journal add <entry>
```
> View them any time with `/journal list`. It will send to your DMs so make sure the bot can message you.

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 😄 Log Your Mood
Check in with how you’re feeling using:
```bash
/mood log
```
> Choose a mood, tag an activity, and optionally add a note!

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 📌 Optional: Set a Channel
Want sprint announcements or giftlist pings in a specific place?
Use:
```bash
/channel set sprints <channel>
/channel set gifts <channel>
```

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### ⏰ Set Up Reminders
Elysium can send personal reminders for reading, moods, habits, or anything else!
Try:
```bash
/reminders set <hour> <minute> [text]
```
> You can also set `/reminders timezone` to make sure it's correct for your location.

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 🧠 Helpful Tips
> - Use `/help` to get an embed with an overview of the bot’s features.
> - Don’t include `< >` or `[ ]` in your commands — just input the values!
> - All features work in DMs unless noted otherwise (some require server channel setup).
> - Most commands give you modals, dropdowns, or buttons to guide you.

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 💬 Still Stuck?
No worries! Head over to the Troubleshooting section, or use:
```bash
/report <your message>
```
to send feedback or ask for help directly.
