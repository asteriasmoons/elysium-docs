Welcome aboard! Whether you're here for moderation, automation, or building beautiful embeds, Pandoryx is designed to be powerful but easy to use.
This guide will walk you through the essentials so you can get up and running in minutes.

### 🔐 Permissions
Pandoryx requires Administrator permissions in your server.
Why? Because it does a lot — managing roles, creating channels, moderating users, building ticket panels, editing messages, and more. Granting full access ensures nothing breaks mid-command.

### 🛠️ Setup Checklist
Once you've invited Pandoryx, here's what to do:
- Create a bot channel (optional but recommended)
- Set up a #bot-commands channel to keep things organized.
- Type `/` in any text channel
This brings up the list of available slash commands.
- Use the command /help for a list of commands with descriptions and that are clickable.

**Test a few basic commands:**

`/warn @user [reason]` – Issue a warning

`/ticketpanel create` – Build an interactive ticket panel

`/embed create` – Start designing a custom embed

Check out the Commands page to explore everything Pandoryx can do.

### ⚙️ Customization & Config
Pandoryx comes with smart defaults, but also supports server-specific settings (more coming soon!).
Watch for the dashboard release to customize things visually.
