# 🛠️ Troubleshooting & FAQ
Having trouble using Elysium Bot? Don’t worry — this page covers common issues, tips for fixing them, and how to report more serious bugs.

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

## ❓ Common Fixes
#### 💬 The bot isn’t responding to commands
- Make sure Elysium has permission to read and send messages in the channel.
- Make sure you’re using slash commands `(/)`, not typing like a text command.
- If the bot was recently added, it may take a moment to register commands — try reinviting it or waiting 1–2 minutes.

#### ❌ I got an error message
Elysium uses Discord’s embed system to let you know what went wrong — if you see an error, try reading the message closely.

If the error says something is “missing”:
- Double-check if you filled out all required fields (anything in `< >` is required).

If the error says the bot doesn’t have permission:
- An admin may need to adjust channel or role permissions.

## 🔄 When in Doubt, Try:
> - Refreshing your Discord app
> - Trying the same command in a different channel or server or even try it in DMs
> - Using `/help` to verify the command name and structure
> - Checking that any required channels or roles have been set up via `/channel view`
