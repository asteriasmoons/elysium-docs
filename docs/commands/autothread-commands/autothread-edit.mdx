# /autothread edit

Edit the embed message that is automatically sent inside each newly created thread. You can customize the title, description, and color to guide users in their thread replies.

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 💬 Usage
```bash
/autothread edit <embed> <channel> [title] [description] [color]
```
- `<embed>` – Prompts you if you want to edit the default embed or not. Sort of useless.
- `<channel>` – The channel where this configuration should apply.
- `[title]` – (Optional) Embed title.
- `[description]` – (Optional) Embed body text.
- `[color]` – (Optional) HEX code for embed color (e.g., `#2ecc71`).
:::info
This embed appears as the first message inside every thread auto-created in the selected channel.
:::

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 📌 Example
```bash
/autothread edit #questions "Thanks for your message!" "Feel free to expand on your post here." #5865f2
```
This will:
- Include a custom title and description
- Style the embed with the provided HEX color

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 🗃️ Notes
> - You must set this per channel — each channel can have its own embed if desired.
> - Embeds help prompt users to respond clearly or follow a format.
> - If no title, description, or color is provided, defaults will be used.
