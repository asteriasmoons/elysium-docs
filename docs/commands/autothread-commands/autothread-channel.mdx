- Save your choices immediately

### 🗃️ Notes
> - When autothreading is enabled, every new message in the selected channels will spawn a public thread for that message.
> - If you add one channel and go back to add another, reselect the already configured channel to keep your settings in tact.
> - You can later edit the embed sent inside each thread using `/autothread edit.`
