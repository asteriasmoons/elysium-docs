# /autothread threadname

Set the naming format for threads created automatically by Pandoryx in a specific channel. You can use variables like `{user}` to dynamically personalize each thread’s name.

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 💬 Usage
```bash
/autothread threadname <channel> <template>
```
- `<channel>` – The channel where autothreads are enabled.
- `<template>` – The naming format you want to use. You can include `{user}` to insert the message sender’s username.
:::info
Use this to keep thread names relevant, clean, or themed for specific channels.
:::

### 📌 Example
```bash
/autothread threadname #support "Support thread – {user}"
```
This will:
- Make every thread auto-created in `#support` use the format `Support thread – [username]`
- Help organize threads visually and make it easier to identify who started each one

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 🗃️ Notes
> - `{user}` is currently the only supported variable, but more may be added in the future.
> - The template must be under Discord’s thread name length limit (100 characters).
> - This is optional — if not set, Pandoryx will use a default naming style.
