# /levelconfig view-thresholds

Display your server’s current level threshold configuration. This shows how many messages are required to reach each level, helping you track or fine-tune the leveling curve.

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 💬 Usage
```bash
/levelconfig view-thresholds
```
:::secondary
Use this to audit or review your level structure — especially after making changes.
:::

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 📌 Example
```bash
/levelconfig view-thresholds
```
This will:
- List the message thresholds for each level (e.g., Level 1: 5 messages, Level 2: 15 messages, etc.)
- Clearly display how many messages are required to reach each level

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 🗃️ Notes
> - If no custom thresholds have been set, you’ll see the default leveling structure.
> - These thresholds are cumulative — meaning each number builds on the previous.
> - To change these values, use `/levelconfig set-thresholds.`
