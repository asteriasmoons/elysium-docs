# /levelconfig set-thresholds

Customize the level thresholds for your server — defining exactly when users level up. This allows you to control the pacing and difficulty of the leveling system.

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 💬 Usage
```bash
/levelconfig set-thresholds <thresholds>
```
- `<thresholds>` – A comma-separated list of level milestones (e.g., 10,20,35,50,...)
:::secondary
The number of values defines how many levels your server will have. Each number represents how many messages it takes to reach that level.
:::

### 📌 Example
```bash
/levelconfig set-thresholds 5,10,15,25,40
```
This will:
- Set Level 1 to require 5 messages
- Level 2 to require 10 more messages (15 total)
- Level 3 to require 15 more (30 total), and so on...

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 🗃️ Notes
> - The values are cumulative — each one adds on top of the previous.
> - The list must be at least 1 entry long.
> - The maximum number of levels is currently limited by how many thresholds you provide.
> - You can reset to default values with `/levelconfig reset-thresholds.`
