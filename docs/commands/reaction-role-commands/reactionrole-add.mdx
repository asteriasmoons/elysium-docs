# /reactionrole add

Attach an emoji and a role to an existing reaction role panel. When users react with the emoji, they’ll automatically receive the assigned role.

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 💬 Usage
```bash
/reactionrole add <name> <emoji> <role>
```
- `<name>` – The name of the reaction role panel to modify.
- `<emoji>` – The emoji users will click to get the role.
- `<role>` – The role to assign when the emoji is clicked.
:::warning
Reaction roles make it easy for users to self-assign roles based on interests, pronouns, pings, or access.

### 📌 Example
```bash
/reactionrole add colors 💙 @Blue
```
This will:
- Add a 💙 emoji to the colors panel
- Assign the @Blue role to anyone who reacts with 💙
- Enable role removal if they unreact (toggle-style)

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 🗃️ Notes
> - Emoji must be unique within the same panel — no duplicates allowed.
> - Custom emojis are supported, but they must be from the server or accessible to the bot.
> - You can add multiple emoji-role pairs to the same panel using this command repeatedly.
