# /reactionrole create

Create a reaction role panel as a message or an embed. This panel lets users assign themselves roles by reacting with specific emojis.

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 💬 Usage
```bash
/reactionrole create <name> [text] [embed_title] [embed_description] [embed_color]
```
- `<name>` – A name for this reaction role panel.
- `[text]` – (Optional) Plain message text to include above the emojis.
- `[embed_title]` – (Optional) Title for the embed.
- `[embed_description]` – (Optional) Embed body text.
- `[embed_color]` – (Optional) Embed color in HEX format (e.g., `#ff66cc`).
:::warning
After creating the panel, use `/reactionrole add` to assign emojis and roles.

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 📌 Example
```
/reactionrole create colors "Choose your color below!" "Pick a Color" "React with an emoji to get your favorite color!" #3498db
```
This will:
- Create a panel named colors
- Display the provided text and embed (if given)
- Wait for emojis and role links to be added via `/reactionrole add`

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 🗃️ Notes
> - You can use either plain text, or an embed.
> - No roles are assigned until you link them with `/reactionrole add.`
> - The panel won’t post automatically — it becomes active as soon as roles are added.
