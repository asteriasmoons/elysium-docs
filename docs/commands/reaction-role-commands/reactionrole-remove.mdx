# /reactionrole remove

Remove a specific emoji-role pair from a reaction role panel. This allows you to clean up individual options without deleting the entire panel.

### 💬 Usage
```bash
/reactionrole remove <name> <emoji>
```
- `<name>` – The name of the reaction role panel.
- `<emoji>` – The emoji associated with the role you want to remove.
:::warning
This is helpful for updating panels or removing outdated role options.

### 📌 Example
```bash
/reactionrole remove colors 💙
```
This will:
- Remove the 💙 emoji from the colors panel
- Prevent users from gaining or losing the associated role when reacting or unreacting
- Clean up the panel without affecting other emoji-role pairs

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 🗃️ Notes
> - This only affects the specified emoji — all other roles in the panel remain active.
> - If the emoji isn’t currently part of the panel, Pandoryx will let you know.
> - You can re-add the same emoji later using `/reactionrole add.`
