# /reactionrole delete

Permanently delete a reaction role panel, including all linked emoji-role pairs. This action cannot be undone.

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 💬 Usage
```bash
/reactionrole delete <name>
```
- `<name>` – The name of the reaction role panel you want to delete.
:::warning
Use this when a panel is no longer needed or when you're starting over from scratch.
:::

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 📌 Example
```bash
/reactionrole delete colors
```
This will:
- Remove the colors reaction role panel from your server
- Clear out all emoji-role mappings connected to that panel
- Disable any active message associated with it

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 🗃️ Notes
> - This does not remove roles from users who already have them — it just deletes the panel.
> - After deletion, you’ll need to re-create the panel and re-add roles if needed.
> - Make sure the panel name is correct to avoid accidental deletion.
