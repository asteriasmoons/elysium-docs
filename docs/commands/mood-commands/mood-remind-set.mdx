### 💬 Usage
```bash
/mood remind set <hour> <minute> <frequency> [timezone]
```
- `<hour>` – The hour you want the reminder to be sent (24-hour format, e.g., 20 for 8pm)
- `<minute>` – The minute you want the reminder to be sent (e.g., 30 for :30 after the hour)
- `<frequency>` – How often you want to be reminded (e.g., daily, weekly)
- `[timezone]` – (Optional) Your timezone in Region/City format (e.g., America/Chicago). If omitted, defaults to the server default.

:::secondary
**Remember that time in the bot runs on 24 hour format. To figure out what time it is at per se 5PM, just add 12 to it to get 17**

### 🗃️ Notes
> - Time uses a 24-hour clock; be sure to enter your desired hour and minute correctly
> - You can change your reminder time or frequency anytime by running this command again
> - If you don’t set a timezone, the bot uses the server default
> - Reminders are private and only sent to you—not the entire server
