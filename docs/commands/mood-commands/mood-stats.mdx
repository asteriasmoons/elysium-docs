# /mood stats

View your mood statistics as insightful percentages and associations. Use this command to see trends in your emotional check-ins—including your most common moods, activity pairings, and summary statements (e.g., “When feeling grateful you also logged hobbies (2 times)”). Stats are based on where you logged moods: server stats only count logs made in that server, and DMs are tracked separately.
