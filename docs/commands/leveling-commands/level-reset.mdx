# /level reset

Reset a specific user’s level back to the starting point. Use this if someone is being re-evaluated, has requested a fresh start, or you're rebalancing levels manually.

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 💬 Usage
```bash
/level reset <user>
```
- `<user>` – The user whose level you want to reset.
:::danger
This is an admin/mod-only command — use it carefully, as it cannot be undone.

### 📌 Example
```bash
/level reset @Jordan
```
This will:
- Set Jordan’s level back to Level 0 (or whatever your server’s baseline is)
- Remove any milestone roles they earned from leveling
- Start them fresh in the leveling system

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 🗃️ Notes
> - This does not remove messages or punish the user in any way — it only resets level tracking.
> - Role rewards tied to previous levels will also be revoked automatically.
> - Great for server restructures or user-requested resets.
