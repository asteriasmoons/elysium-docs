# /level profile

View your own or another user’s current level and role-based milestones. This command gives a quick overview of someone's progress in your server’s level system.

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 💬 Usage
```bash
/level profile [user]
```
- `[user]` – (Optional) The user whose level profile you want to view. If omitted, defaults to you.
:::danger
No XP here! Levels are granted directly based on message activity and thresholds — this command shows where someone stands.

### 📌 Example
```bash
/level profile @Jordan
```
This will:
- Show Jordan’s current level
- Display any milestone roles they’ve earned through the level system
- Give context for how far along they are in the leveling structure

### 🗃️ Notes
> - There’s no XP bar — just clean level tracking.
> - Role rewards are visible if configured with `/level role-add.`
> - If leveling is disabled or the user hasn’t been active, Pandoryx will let you know.
