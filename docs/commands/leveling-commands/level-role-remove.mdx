Remove a level-based role reward from your server’s leveling system. This unlinks the role from the specified level.

### 📌 Example
```bash
/level role-remove 10
```
This will:
- Remove the role currently assigned to Level 10
- Prevent users from receiving that role when reaching Level 10 in the future

### 🗃️ Notes
> - This does not remove the role from users who already earned it. You may want to do a `/level reset` to remove it.
> - If the level has no associated role, Pandoryx will notify you.
> - You can reassign a new role using `/level role-add.`
