- Ensure the role is retained unless manually removed or reset

### 🗃️ Notes
> - The bot needs Manage Roles permission and must be higher than the role it’s assigning.
> - You can create multiple level-role pairs for tiered role progression.
> - If a user’s level is reset, they’ll also lose the associated milestone roles.
