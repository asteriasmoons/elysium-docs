# /rolepanel editembed

### 💬 Usage
```bash
/rolepanel editembed <name> [title] [description] [color]
```
- `<name>` – The name of the role panel you want to edit.
- `[title]` – (Optional) A new embed title.
- `[description]` – (Optional) A new embed description.
- `[color]` – (Optional) HEX code for a new embed color (e.g., `#5865f2`).

Customizing the embed helps users understand what the panel is for and what their role options mean.

### 📌 Example
```bash
/rolepanel editembed pronouns "Choose Your Pronouns" "Select the pronouns that best describe you." #ff99cc
```
This will:
- Update the pronouns panel’s embed with a new title, description, and color
- You will have to republish the role panel as the existing messages are not updated automatically.

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 🗃️ Notes
> - This does not re-post the panel — it updates the embed where it already exists.
> - If no field is provided, nothing changes.
> - Ideal to run after adding roles to your panel for extra context.
