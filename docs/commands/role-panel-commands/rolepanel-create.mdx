# /rolepanel create

Create a new role panel using either buttons or a select menu. This panel allows users to assign themselves roles by clicking buttons or choosing from a dropdown.

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 💬 Usage
```bash
/rolepanel create <name> <type (button/select)> [select_mode (multi/single)]
```
- `<name>` – A name to identify the role panel.
- `<type>` – Choose button for clickable buttons or select for a dropdown menu.
- `[select_mode]` – (Optional) multi or single (only applies if type is select).
:::success
This command only sets up the structure. Use /rolepanel add-role next to add role choices.

### 📌 Example
```bash
/rolepanel create pronouns select multi
```
This will:
- Create a new role panel named pronouns
- Use a multi-select dropdown so users can choose more than one role
- Allow further customization using `/rolepanel add-role` and `/rolepanel editembed`

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 🗃️ Notes
> - If you choose button, each role will get its own clickable button.
> - If you choose select, the panel appears as a dropdown. Use multi for multiple role selection, or leave blank (defaults to single) for one at a time.
> - This does not send the panel into a channel yet — use `/rolepanel publish` for that.
