# /rolepanel publish

Send your configured role panel into a specific channel so users can begin selecting their roles. This is the final step in making your role panel live and interactive.

### 💬 Usage
```bash
/rolepanel publish <name> <channel>
```
- `<name>` – The name of the role panel you want to publish.
- `<channel>` – The target channel where the panel should be posted.
:::success
After publishing, users will be able to interact with your panel and assign themselves roles immediately.

### 📌 Example
```bash
/rolepanel publish pronouns #role-selection
```
This will:
- Post the pronouns panel (buttons or select menu) into `#role-selection`
- Use the current embed configuration and all attached roles
- Go live for members to use

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 🗃️ Notes
> - Make sure you've already created the panel and added roles using `/rolepanel create` and `/rolepanel add-role.`
> - You can publish the same panel to multiple channels if needed.
> - If you update the embed using `/rolepanel editembed`, changes will not reflect in the published panel automatically. You must repost.
