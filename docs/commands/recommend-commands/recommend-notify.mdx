# /recommend notify

Set where you want to receive your automatic book recommendations from Elysium. Use this command to choose between getting recs in your DMs (private messages) or in a specific server channel.

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 💬 Usage
```bash
/recommend notify <channel or dms>
```
- `<channel or dms>` – Choose DMs to receive recommendations privately, or mention a channel (e.g., #book-recs) to get them in a server channel.

**Its actually suggested that you get these sent to your own DMs to avoid any problems.**

### 📌 Example
```bash
/recommend notify DMs
```
> This will send all your automatic book recommendations as private messages from Elysium
```bash
/recommend notify #reading-corner
```
> This will send your recommendations to the #reading-corner channel in your server

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 🗃️ Notes
> - DMs are the recommended option—this keeps your recommendations private and avoids any channel permission issues
> - If you want recs in a server channel, you must have permission to post there, and Elysium must also have permission to send messages
> - You can change your notification location at any time
> - If neither is set, you may miss automatic recs!
