# /recommend interval 

Set how often you receive automatic book recommendations from Elysium. Use this command to control the frequency of recs sent to you—daily, weekly, monthly, or turn them off entirely.

### 💬 Usage
```bash
/recommend interval <daily/weekly/monthly/none>
```
- `<daily/weekly/monthly/none>` – Choose daily, weekly, or monthly for regular book recs, or none to disable automatic recommendations.

### 📌 Example
```bash
/recommend interval weekly
```
> This will schedule Elysium to send you a new book recommendation every week
```bash
/recommend interval none
```
> This will disable automatic book recommendations—you’ll only get recs when you request them

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 🗃️ Notes
> - You can change your interval at any time to fit your reading pace
> - Use none if you only want recommendations when you manually request them
> - Automatic recs are sent to the place you’ve set with `/recommend notify`
> - Great for making sure recommendations arrive just as often as you want them
