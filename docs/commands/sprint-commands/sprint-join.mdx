### 🗃️ Notes
> - You must join each sprint you wish to participate in—joining is per sprint, not ongoing
> - Enter your actual starting page for accurate results
> - If you join late, you’ll be counted from the page you input when you join
> - Use `/sprint finish` to log your final page when the sprint ends
