# /sprint finish

Submit your ending page number before a reading sprint ends to get your score on the leaderboard. Use this command to let Elysium know how many pages you finished during the sprint so your reading achievement is counted!

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 💬 Usage
```bash
/sprint finish <ending pages>
```
- `<ending pages>` – The page number you reached by the end of the sprint

:::warning
**You will want to use this command before the sprint is officially over.**
:::

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 📌 Example
```bash
/sprint finish 112
```
This will:
- Record that you finished on page 112
- Calculate the number of pages read during the sprint (based on your starting page from when you joined)
- Add your score to the sprint leaderboard and display your results

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 🗃️ Notes
> - You must join a sprint and log a starting page with /sprint join before using this command
> - Submit your ending page before the sprint timer runs out or right after it ends
> - Your score is based on the difference between starting and ending page numbers
> - Helps track your reading speed and progress during sprints
