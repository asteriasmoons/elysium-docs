# /sprint set role 

Set a role to be pinged for reading sprints. Use this command to automatically notify a specific role in your server before a sprint ends—keeping everyone in the loop and boosting participation!

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 💬 Usage
```bash
/sprint set role <role mention>
```
- `<role mention>` – Mention the role you want Elysium to ping for sprint reminders (e.g., @Book Club).

:::warning
**Choose a role that is specifically made for sprints so you don't bother your entire server.**

### 📌 Example
```bash
/sprint set role @Readers
```
This will:
- Set `@Readers` as the sprint notification role
- Automatically ping this role 5 minutes before the sprint ends and again at sprint end
- Make sure everyone interested gets a heads-up and can submit their progress

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 🗃️ Notes
> - You must have appropriate server permissions to set the ping role
> - Elysium will ping the chosen role during every sprint in your server
> - Only one role can be set at a time; running the command again replaces the previous role
> - Great for organized groups or reading clubs
