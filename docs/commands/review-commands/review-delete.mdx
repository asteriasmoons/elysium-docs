### 💬 Usage
```bash
/review delete <book> <author>
```
- `<book>` – The title of the book whose review you want to delete

/review delete "Legends & Lattes" "Travis Baldree"
```
This will:
- Permanently remove your review for “Legends & Lattes” by Travis Baldree
- Free you up to submit a new review for the same book in the future
- Confirm the removal with a message or embed
