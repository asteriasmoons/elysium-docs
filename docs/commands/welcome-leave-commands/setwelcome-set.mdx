# /setwelcome set

Configure a custom welcome message that will be sent when a new member joins your server. You can use plain text, a saved embed, or both.

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 💬 Usage
```bash
/setwelcome set <type> <channel> [embedname] [text]
```
- `<type>` – Choose text, embed, or both to define the message format.
- `<channel>` – The channel where the welcome message should be sent.
- `[embedname]` – (Optional) The name of a saved embed (created using `/embed create`).
- `[text]` – (Optional) A plain text message to accompany or replace the embed.

:::success
Supports message tags like `{user}`, `{username}`, `{server}` for dynamic content. Use `/messagetags` to see all available tags.

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 📌 Example
```bash
/setwelcome set both #welcome welcome_embed "Welcome to {server}, {mention}!"
```
This will:
- Send the `welcome_embed` embed along with the custom text when a new member joins
- Post the message in the `#welcome channel`
- Tag the new member and reference the server name dynamically

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 🗃️ Notes
> - You must have created the embed with /embed create before referencing it here.
> - If you choose text but don't provide a message, nothing will be sent.
> - You may also use the tags in your embed as well and they will show up live.
> - Use `/setwelcome test` to preview the message before it goes live.
