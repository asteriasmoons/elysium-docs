# /setleave test

Send a preview of your configured leave message to the target channel. Use this to verify how your embed or text message will look when a user leaves the server.

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 💬 Usage
```bash
/setleave test
```

:::success
No input is required. This command will simulate a user leaving the server and display the configured leave message.
:::

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 📌 Example
```bash
/setleave test
```
This will:
- Send your currently configured leave message to the selected leave channel
- Replace tags like `{user}`, `{username}`, and `{server}` with fake data for testing
- Show both text and embed (if type was set to both)

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 🗃️ Notes
> - Make sure you’ve already set a leave message using `/setleave set`, or this command won’t do anything.
> - This is a safe way to test formatting before an actual member leaves.
> - Dynamic tags are replaced in the preview exactly as they would be during real use.
