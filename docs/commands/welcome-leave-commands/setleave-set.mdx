# /setleave set

Configure a custom leave message that will be sent when a member leaves your server. You can use text, a saved embed, or both.

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 💬 Usage
```bash
/setleave set <type> <channel> [embedname] [text]
```
- `<type>` – Choose text, embed, or both depending on how you want the message to appear.
- `<channel>` – The channel where the leave message should be posted.
- `[embedname]` – (Optional) Name of an embed created with /embed create.
- `[text]` – (Optional) A message to include alongside or instead of the embed.

:::success
This command supports dynamic tags like `{user}`, `{username}`, and `{server}`. Use `/messagetags` to view all available variables.

### 📌 Example
```bash
/setleave set embed #goodbye goodbye_embed
```
This will:
- Send the `goodbye_embed` when a user leaves the server
- Post the message in the `#goodbye` channel
- Not include any plain text (since type is set to embed only)

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 🗃️ Notes
> - Be sure the embed exists before referencing it — use `/embed` list to check.
> - You can test your configuration anytime with `/setleave` test.
> - Leave messages are great for acknowledging departures or giving a soft goodbye vibe.
