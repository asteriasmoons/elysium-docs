### 💬 Usage
```bash
/setwelcome test
```

:::success
No input is needed. This command will simulate a new member joining and show the current welcome message setup.

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 📌 Example
```bash
/setwelcome test
```
This will:
- Trigger the current welcome message exactly as it would appear for a new member
- Post it in the configured welcome channel
- Replace dynamic tags like `{user}`, `{username}`, and `{server}` with mock data

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 🗃️ Notes
> - Great for testing embeds, tag formatting, or layout without needing someone to join the server.
> - If no welcome message has been set with `/setwelcome set`, this command won’t produce anything.
> - You can re-run this anytime you update your embed or text message.
