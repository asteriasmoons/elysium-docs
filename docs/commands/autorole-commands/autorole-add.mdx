# /autorole add

Add a role to the list of autoroles. Any time a new member joins the server, Pandoryx will automatically assign them this role.

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 💬 Usage
```bash
/autorole add <role>
```
- `<role>` – The role you want to automatically assign to new members.
:::secondary
This is great for assigning base roles like @Member or granting instant access to intro channels.

### 📌 Example
```bash
/autorole add @Member
```
This will:
- Add the @Member role to your server’s autorole list
- Automatically apply that role to users when they join your server (if Pandoryx has permissions)

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 🗃️ Notes
> - Pandoryx must have Manage Roles permission, and its role must be higher than the one it’s assigning.
> - You can add multiple autoroles using this command repeatedly.
> - Roles are assigned immediately after a user joins — no interaction required.
