# /autorole remove

Remove a role from your server’s autorole list. After removal, new users will no longer receive this role when they join.

:::secondary
Use this when retiring a default role or reworking your server's access system.

### 📌 Example
```bash
/autorole remove @Guest
```
This will:
- Remove the @Guest role from the autorole system
- Prevent it from being auto-assigned to future members
- Leave all existing members who already received the role unaffected

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 🗃️ Notes
> - Removing the role does not unassign it from current members — it just stops future auto-assignment.
> - If the role isn’t in the autorole list, Pandoryx will let you know.
