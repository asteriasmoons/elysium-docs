### 📌 Example
```bash
/bumpreminder preview

- Let you review the title, description, and role mention (if configured)
- Help you confirm your formatting or plan edits with the other commands

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 🗃️ Notes
> - This is a preview only — it does not actually ping anyone or affect bump cooldowns.
> - Great for double-checking the design before going live with reminders.
> - Make sure you’ve configured the reminder message using `/bumpreminder set-title`, `set-description`, and `set-role`.
