### 📌 Example
```bash
/bumpreminder set-channel #bump-here

This will:
- Set `#bump-here` as the designated bump reminder channel
- Ensure the reminder embed appears in the right place for your community to see it

### 🗃️ Notes
> - This must be a text-based channel where the bot has permission to send messages and embeds.
> - You’ll also want to customize the reminder’s appearance using `/bumpreminder set-title` and `/bumpreminder set-description`.
> - Consider pairing this with `/bumpreminder set-role` if you want the reminder to ping a role.
