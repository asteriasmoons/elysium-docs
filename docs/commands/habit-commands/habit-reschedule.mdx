# /habit reschedule

Reschedule a habit for a different time. Use this command to update the scheduled hour and minute for any of your habits—perfect if your routine changes or you want to receive reminders at a new time.

### 💬 Usage
```bash
/habit reschedule <name> <hour> <minute>
```
- `<name>` – The exact name of the habit you want to reschedule (as shown in /habit list)
- `<hour>` – The new hour you want the habit reminder to trigger (24-hour format, e.g., 18 for 6pm)
- `<minute>` – The new minute you want the habit reminder to trigger (e.g., 30 for :30 after the hour)

:::warning
**If you reschedule your habit make sure to use 24 hour format to get the reminder at the appropriate timing.

### 📌 Example
```bash
/habit reschedule Hydrate 10 30
```
This will:
- Update the “Hydrate” habit to remind you daily (or weekly) at 10:30
- Automatically adjust the habit’s schedule to use the new time for future reminders and tracking
- Confirm the new schedule with an embed or message

### 🗃️ Notes
> - Only habits you’ve created can be rescheduled
> - Times use 24-hour clock (e.g., 0 is midnight, 13 is 1pm)
> - Use this command whenever your schedule changes or you want to experiment with new habit times
> - Rescheduling does not reset your XP or habit stats—only the reminder time is updated
