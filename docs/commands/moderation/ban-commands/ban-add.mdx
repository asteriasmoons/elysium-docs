# /ban add

Ban a user from the server and log the action with a reason note. This command is part 
of the Moderation module.

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 💬 Usage
```
/ban add <userid> <reason>
```
- `<userid>` – The Discord user ID of the person you want to ban.
- `<reason>` – A brief explanation for the ban. This will be stored in the server’s case 
log and may be shown in mod logs.

:::success
You must have the proper server permissions to use this command. Pandoryx also 
needs permission to ban members and must have a higher role than the target.
