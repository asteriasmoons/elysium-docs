# /warn add

Warn a user and log the reason for moderation tracking. The user will automatically receive a DM notifying them of the warning (if DMs are open).

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 💬 Usage
```bash
/warn add <user> <reason>
```
- `<user>` – The member you want to warn.
- `<reason>` – The reason for the warning. This will be logged and visible to moderators, and sent to the user via DM.

:::success
You must have the proper moderation permissions to issue warnings. Pandoryx must also have permission to send DMs.

### 📌 Example

/warn add @DisruptiveUser Excessive off-topic messages during an event
```
This will:
- Log a warning against @DisruptiveUser
- DM the user with the warning reason
- Save the warning in your server’s moderation records

### 🗃️ Notes
> - Warnings are numbered per user — the first warning is #1, the second is #2, and so on.
> - If the user has DMs closed or blocked the bot, they will not receive the DM, but the warning will still be logged.
> - Use `/warn view` to see a user's warning history, and /warn remove to delete a specific warning.
