# /warn remove 

Remove a specific warning from a user’s moderation history by referencing their warning number.

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 💬 Usage
```bash
/warn remove <user> <number>
```
- `<user>` – The member whose warning you want to remove.
- `<number>` – The warning number you want to delete (from that user’s warning list).

:::success
Only users with moderation permissions can run this command. Warning numbers are user-specific, not global.

### 📌 Example
```bash
/warn remove @DisruptiveUser 2
```
This will:
- Remove warning #2 from @DisruptiveUser’s warning history
- Return a confirmation message once the warning has been successfully deleted

### 🗃️ Notes
> - Warning numbers can be viewed with /warn view.
> - Deleting a warning will not renumber the others — the numbers stay tied to their original entry.
> - If you attempt to remove a warning that doesn't exist (e.g., wrong number), Pandoryx will let you know.
