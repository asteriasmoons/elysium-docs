# /kick add

Kick a user from the server and log the action with a reason note. This command is part of the Moderation module.

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 💬 Usage
```bash
/kick add <userid> <reason>
```
- `<userid>` – The Discord user ID of the member you want to kick.
- `<reason>` – A short explanation for the kick, which will be saved in your moderation logs.

:::success
You must have permission to kick members. Pandoryx also needs permission and a higher role than the user being kicked.

### 📌 Example
```bash
/kick add 123456789012345678 Inappropriate behavior in voice chat
```
This will:
- Kick the user from the server immediately
- Log the action internally with the reason provided
- Optionally DM the user (depending on your server's moderation settings)

### 🗃️ Notes
> - This command only works on members currently in the server.
> - If the kick fails (e.g., due to missing permissions or role hierarchy), Pandoryx will notify you.
> - You can view this kick case later using /kick view.
