# /kick remove

Remove a previously logged kick case from Pandoryx’s moderation records. This does not undo the kick — it only deletes the log entry.

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 💬 Usage
```bash
/kick remove <case>
```
- `<case>` – The case number of the kick entry you want to remove. This number is shown in `/kick list.`

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 📌 Example
```bash
/kick remove 7
```
This will:
- Delete kick case #7 from your moderation log
- Return a confirmation message once complete

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 🗃️ Notes
> - This action only affects the bot’s internal log — it will not re-add the user to the server or undo the action.
> - If the case number doesn’t exist, Pandoryx will notify you.
> - Use `/kick list` first if you’re unsure of the case number.
