# /note add

Privately add a moderation note to a user’s record. Notes are only visible to staff and are useful for tracking user behavior over time without issuing a formal warning.

### 💬 Usage
```bash
/note add <user> <text>
```
- `<user>` – The member you want to add a note to.
- `<text>` – The content of the note — usually a short description of behavior or context.

:::success
This is an admin-only command. Notes are not visible to the user and do not trigger any notifications.

### 📌 Example
```bash
/note add @SomeUser Frequently toes the line but hasn't technically broken rules
```
This will:
- Log the note to @SomeUser’s internal profile
- Assign it a number in their note history
- Allow it to be referenced later via /note view or removed with /note remove

### 🗃️ Notes
> - Notes are ordered numerically, starting with #1 for each user.
> - Notes are a great option for informal documentation — think of them as a mod notebook.
> - No DMs or public log messages are sent when notes are added.
