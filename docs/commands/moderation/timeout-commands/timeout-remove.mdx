# /timeout remove

Manually remove a timeout from a user before it expires and optionally log a reason for lifting the restriction.

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 💬 Usage
```bash
/timeout remove <user> [reason]
```
- `<user>` – The member whose timeout you want to remove.
- `[reason]` – (Optional) A note explaining why the timeout was removed. This will be saved in the moderation log.

:::success
Both you and Pandoryx must have the Timeout Members permission, and Pandoryx’s role must be higher than the user’s.

### 📌 Example
```bash
/timeout remove @User "Issue resolved – they apologized"
```
This will:
- Immediately end the timeout for @User
- Log the reason “Issue resolved – they apologized” if provided

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 🗃️ Notes
> - This command only works on users who are currently timed out.
> - If no reason is provided, the removal will still be logged, but without context.
> - You can view the original timeout case with /timeout view.
