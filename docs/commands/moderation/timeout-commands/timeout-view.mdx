# /timeout view

View detailed information about a specific timeout case logged by Pandoryx. This includes who issued the timeout, when it was applied, and why.

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 💬 Usage
```bash
/timeout view <case>
```
- `<case>` – The case number of the timeout you want to review. Case numbers are shown in /timeout list.

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 📌 Example
```bash
/timeout view 5
```
This will:
- Display full details for timeout case #5
- Timed-out user ID
- Moderator who issued the timeout
- Duration
- Reason
- Timestamp of when it began

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 🗃️ Notes
> - You must use the case number, not a user ID.
> - If the case number is invalid or the timeout has already expired and been cleared from logs, Pandoryx will let you know.
> - Helpful for accountability and reviewing past actions.
