# /ticketpanel setrole

Set the staff role that will be pinged whenever a user opens a ticket through a specific panel.

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 💬 Usage
```bash
/ticketpanel setrole <name> <role>
```
- `<name>` – The name of the ticket panel you want to configure.
- `<role>` – The role to ping when a new ticket is opened from this panel.

:::success
Each panel can have its own assigned role. This lets you route different ticket types to different staff teams.

### 📌 Example
```bash
/ticketpanel setrole support @SupportTeam
```
This will:
- Assign the @SupportTeam role to the support panel
- Ping that role each time a user opens a ticket from the panel

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 🗃️ Notes
> - You can update the role at any time using the same command.
> - If no role is set, no one will be pinged on ticket creation (not recommended).
> - This does not restrict who can see or manage the ticket — it's just for alerts.
