# /ticketpanel create

Create a new ticket panel configuration that can be posted to a channel for users to open private ticket threads.

### 💬 Usage
```bash
/ticketpanel create <name>

Ticket panel names must be unique per server. Use something simple like support, appeals, or staff-help.

### 📌 Example
```bash
/ticketpanel create support
```
This will:
- Create a new ticket panel config called support
- Allow you to later customize its behavior, add roles, or publish it to a channel

### 🗃️ Notes
> - Creating a panel does not automatically post it — use `/ticketpanel post` when you're ready to send it to a channel.
**You can further configure the panel with:**
> - `/ticketpanel setrole` – Choose who gets pinged on ticket creation
> - `/ticketpanel settranscriptchannel` – Where transcripts are saved

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 🔍 Related Commands
`/ticketpanel post` – Post the panel to a channel

`/ticketpanel setrole` – Set the staff role for this panel
 
 `/ticketpanel edit` – Customize the panel’s appearance or behavior

`/ticketpanel list` – View all panels on the server

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

This command will reply with a UI for configuring tickets. There will be many buttons and select menus so that you have full control over your tickets and ticket panels.
