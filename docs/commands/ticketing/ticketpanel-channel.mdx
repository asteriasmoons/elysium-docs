Set the channel where transcripts from closed tickets will be automatically saved. This is useful for recordkeeping, accountability, and moderation follow-up.

### 💬 Usage
```bash
/ticketpanel settranscriptchannel <name> <channel>
```
- `<name>` – The name of the ticket panel you want to configure.
- `<channel>` – The text channel where ticket transcripts will be posted after a ticket is closed.

:::success
Choose a private staff-only channel so transcripts don’t clutter public chats.

### 📌 Example
```bash
/ticketpanel settranscriptchannel support #ticket-logs
```
This will:
- Assign the `#ticket-logs` channel as the transcript destination for the support ticket panel
- Automatically post transcript messages there whenever a ticket from that panel is closed

### 🗃️ Notes
> - This must be set per panel — if you have multiple panels, configure each one individually.
> - Pandoryx must have permission to send messages and embeds in the target channel.
**Transcripts typically include:**
> - The original message that opened the ticket
> - All messages exchanged in the thread
> - Timestamps and usernames
