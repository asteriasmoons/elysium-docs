# /ticketpanel post

Post a configured ticket panel into a public channel so users can begin opening tickets. This is how you make a ticket panel usable by your community.

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 💬 Usage
```bash
/ticketpanel post <name>
```
- `<name>` – The name of the ticket panel you want to post. Must match a panel you’ve already created with `/ticketpanel create.`

:::success
This command must be used in the channel where you want the panel message to appear.

### 📌 Example
```bash
/ticketpanel post support
```
This will:
- Post the support ticket panel in the current channel
- Display an embed (if configured) and a button for users to open a private ticket
- Connect new tickets to your configured staff role and transcript channel (if set)

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 🗃️ Notes
> - You can run this in multiple channels if you want the same panel available in different places.
> - If you later update the panel using /ticketpanel edit, you should re-run this command to reflect the changes.
> - The panel message is persistent — users can open tickets at any time.
