### 🗃️ Notes
> - Watching a repo means Pandoryx will send live updates about events like commits, issues, or releases directly to a selected channel.
> - To start or stop watching repos, use `/github watch` and `/github unwatch.`
> - Only users with the proper permissions (typically Admin) can configure or view feeds.
