# /github unwatch

Stop watching a GitHub repository in your server. This removes the repo from Pandoryx’s active watch list and stops future updates from being posted.

/github unwatch <repo link>
```
- `<repo link>` – The full URL to the GitHub repository you want to stop tracking.

### 📌 Example
```bash
/github unwatch https://github.com/your-org/pandoryx-bot
```
This will:
- Immediately stop Pandoryx from sending updates for that repo
- Remove it from your watch list
- Free up space for new repo feeds

### 🗃️ Notes
> - You must provide a valid GitHub repo URL.
> - This only affects the repo for the current server — other servers watching it remain unaffected.
> - Only users with the necessary permissions (typically Admin) can unwatch repositories.
