# /verify panel_edit

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 💬 Usage

- `[description]` – (Optional) Updated embed description.

### 📌 Example
```
/verify panel_edit @Member "Welcome to the server!" "Click to verify and access the rest of the community." #7289da ✅
```
This will:
- Update the verification panel assigned to **@Member**
- Replace the embed title, description, and color
- Refresh the button’s emoji if provided

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 🗃️ Notes
> - This does not repost the panel — it edits the embed and button wherever it's already been posted.
> - If you want to move the panel to a different channel, you’ll need to manually delete and re-run `/verify panel.`
