# /verify panel

Create a verification panel that allows new users to verify themselves by clicking a button. Upon clicking, the specified role will be added to them — granting access to the rest of your server.

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 💬 Usage
```bash
/verify panel <role> [title] [description] [color] [emoji]
```
- `<role>` – The role to give users when they verify.
- `[title]` – (Optional) Title of the embed.
- `[description]` – (Optional) Body text of the embed.
- `[color]` – (Optional) Embed color in HEX format (e.g. `#43b581`).
- `[emoji]` – (Optional) Emoji to appear on the verification button.
:::success
This is ideal for servers with restricted access channels — only verified users will be able to see them.

### 📌 Example
```bash
/verify panel @Member "Welcome!" "Click the button below to verify yourself." #00cc99 ✅
```
This will:
- Post a verification panel with a button
- Automatically assign the **@Member** role to anyone who clicks it
- Use the provided embed title, description, color, and emoji if included

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 🗃️ Notes
> - Verification panels are usually placed in a channel like `#verify-here` or `#start-here.`
> - Users can only click the button once — after receiving the role, clicking again does nothing.
> - Make sure Pandoryx has permission to manage roles and that its role is higher than the one it’s assigning.
