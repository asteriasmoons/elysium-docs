# /reminder delete

Delete an existing reminder from your server’s schedule. This will stop it from repeating and remove all its configuration.

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 💬 Usage
```bash
/reminder delete <name>
```
- `<name>` – The name of the reminder you want to delete.
:::secondary
Use this when a reminder is no longer relevant, or you want to clean up your list.
:::

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 📌 Example
```bash
/reminder delete hydration
```
This will:
- Permanently delete the hydration reminder
- Remove its schedule and configuration
- Prevent it from posting in the future

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 🗃️ Notes
> - Reminder names are case-insensitive.
> - This only affects the reminder — it won’t delete any past messages it posted.
> - If the name doesn’t match any existing reminder, Pandoryx will let you know.
