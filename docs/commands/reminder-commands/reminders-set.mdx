# /reminders set 

Set a new reading reminder—or any kind of repeating reminder. Use this command to schedule reminders with a custom message at a specific time every day, so you never forget your next reading session, task, or self-care check-in.

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 💬 Usage
```bash
/reminders set <hour> <minute> [text]
```
- `<hour>` – The hour to receive the reminder (24-hour format, e.g., 21 for 9pm)
- `<minute>` – The minute after the hour (e.g., 30 for :30 after)
- `[text]` – (Optional) The message you want your reminder to display (e.g., “Time to read!”). If left blank, a default message will be used.

:::warning
**Use this command to schedule any kind of reminder regardless of its context. This command can be used in DM as well.**
