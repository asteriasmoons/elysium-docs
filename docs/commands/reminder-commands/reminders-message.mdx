# /reminders message 

Change the message text for a specific reminder by its index number. Use this command to update what your reminder says—perfect for personalizing or clarifying your notifications.

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 💬 Usage
```bash
/reminders message <index> <text>
```
- `<index>` – The number of the reminder you want to edit (as listed in /reminders list)
- `<text>` – The new message you want the reminder to display

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 📌 Example
```bash
/reminders message 2 Time to start your evening reading sprint!
```
This will:
- Change the text of your second reminder to “Time to start your evening reading sprint!”
- Keep the reminder’s time and other settings the same
- Confirm the update with a message or embed

### 🗃️ Notes
> - Use `/reminders list` first to see index numbers for your reminders
> - Only reminders in your current context (server or DM) can be updated
> - Changing the message won’t affect the schedule or delivery of the reminder
> - Use this to make your reminders more helpful or motivating
