### 💬 Usage
```bash
/reminders reschedule <index> <hour> <minute>
```
- `<index>` – The number of the reminder to update (as shown in /reminders list)
- `<hour>` – The new hour for the reminder (24-hour format, e.g., 20 for 8pm)
- `<minute>` – The new minute for the reminder (e.g., 15 for :15 after the hour)
