### 📌 Example
```bash
/reminders list
```
This will:
- Display an embed listing all your reminders for the context in which you ran the command
- If run in a server: shows reminders set for that server
- If run in DMs: shows your personal (DM) reminders
- For each reminder, you’ll see its index number, the message text, and its scheduled time
- Make it easy to find and manage reminders

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 🗃️ Notes
> - Reminders are context-specific: server reminders only show up in servers, and DM reminders only show up in DMs
> - Each reminder is assigned an index number for management—use this number to edit, remove, or reschedule the reminder
> - The channel information is not shown—reminders are just listed for the current context
> - Review this list often to keep your reminders up to date
