### 💬 Usage
```bash
/reminders channel add <channel>
```
- `<channel>` – Mention the channel (e.g., #reminders) where you want reminders to appear.

:::warning
**This is for where you want reminders to go to in your server.**

### 📌 Example
```bash
/reminders channel add #reminders
```
This will:
- Set `#reminders` as an official channel for reading reminders
- Allow Elysium to post repeating reminders and notifications in that channel
- Support multiple reminder channels per server if you want (add as many as you need)

### 🗃️ Notes
> - Only users with appropriate server permissions can designate channels
> - Elysium needs permission to send messages in the selected channel
> - You can add multiple channels for reminders, making it easy to keep different topics or groups organized
> - To see all reminder channels, use /reminders channel list
