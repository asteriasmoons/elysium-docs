# /reminders channel remove

Remove a channel from being designated for reminders. Use this command to stop Elysium from sending repeating reading reminders to a specific channel in your server.

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 💬 Usage
```bash
/reminders channel remove <channel>
```
- `<channel>` – Mention the channel you want to remove from the reminder list (e.g., #reminders).

:::warning
**This will stop reminders from being sent in the specified channel. If no channel is set with the command then it defaults to the current channel.**

### 📌 Example
```bash
/reminders channel remove #reminders
```
This will:
- Remove `#reminders` from the list of channels set to receive reminder notifications
- Elysium will no longer send reminder messages to this channel
- Confirm removal with a message or embed

### 🗃️ Notes

> - Use `/reminders channel list` to double-check channels before removing
