# /embed view

Preview a saved embed directly in the channel without officially posting it. Useful for double-checking formatting, colors, or layout before sharing publicly.

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 💬 Usage
```bash
/embed view <name>
```
- `<name>` – The name of the embed you want to preview. Must match an existing saved embed.

:::success
This command lets you see the embed as it will appear, but it won’t count as a public post. Great for safe testing.

### 📌 Example
```bash
/embed view rules
```
This will:
- Display the rules embed in the current channel
- Let you visually confirm that everything looks right
- Not ping anyone or trigger notifications

### 🗃️ Notes
> - Ideal for reviewing edits made with /embed edit before using /embed send.
> - If the embed name doesn’t exist, Pandoryx will notify you.
> - Only visible to those with permission to see the channel where the preview is run.
