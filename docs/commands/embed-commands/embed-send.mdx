# /embed send

Post one of your saved embeds directly into the current channel. Use this to publicly share an embed you've created and stored with Pandoryx.

### 💬 Usage
```bash
/embed send <name>
```
- `<name>` – The name of the embed you want to send. Must match one that has already been created and saved.

:::success
This command sends the embed to the channel you run it in, so be sure you’re in the right place before using it!

```bash
/embed send rules
```

- Display it exactly as it was configured using `/embed create` or `/embed edit`

### 🗃️ Notes
