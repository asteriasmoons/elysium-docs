# /embed create

Start building a custom embed using an interactive builder with buttons and modals — no need to write raw JSON!

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 💬 Usage
```bash
/embed create <name>
```
- `<name>` – A name to save the embed under. You’ll use this name later to edit, view, or send the embed.

:::success
Embed names must be unique per server. Choose something short and memorable like welcome, rules, or announcement1.
:::

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 📌 Example
```bash
/embed create rules
```
This will:
- Create a new embed configuration called rules

Launch a guided embed editor where you can:
- Set a title, description, color, and footer
- Add author, thumbnail, image, and more
- Save the embed to your server’s embed list for reuse

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 🗃️ Notes
> - You can create and store multiple embeds per server.
> - The editor uses buttons and pop-up modals — no code required.
> - You’ll need to use /embed send to actually post the embed into a channel.
