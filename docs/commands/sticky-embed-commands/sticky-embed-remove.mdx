# /sticky embed remove

Remove a sticky embed from a specific channel without deleting it from your server’s saved embeds. This stops the embed from re-posting in that channel.

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 💬 Usage
```bash
/sticky embed remove <name> <channel>
```
- `<name>` – The name of the sticky embed you want to remove.
- `<channel>` – The channel you want to stop the embed from sticking in.
:::success
This command is useful when you want to keep the embed saved but disable it in a specific channel.

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 📌 Example
```bash
/sticky embed remove rules #general
```
This will:
- Stop the rules sticky embed from re-posting in `#general`
- Keep the embed saved and available to send again elsewhere or later

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 🗃️ Notes
> - This does not delete the saved embed — only removes it from the specified channel.
> - You can re-add it at any time using `/sticky embed send.`
> - If the embed was never posted in that channel, Pandoryx will notify you.
