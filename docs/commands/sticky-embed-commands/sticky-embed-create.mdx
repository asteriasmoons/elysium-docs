# /sticky embed create

Create a sticky embed message that will automatically stay visible at the bottom of a channel. Whenever someone sends a new message, Pandoryx will re-post the embed to keep it “stuck.”

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 💬 Usage
```bash
/sticky embed create <name> <title> <description> [color]
```
- `<name>` – The name to save the sticky embed under.
- `<title>` – The title of the embed.
- `<description>` – The main body text of the embed.
- `[color]` – (Optional) The embed color in HEX format (e.g., `#7289da`).

:::success
Sticky messages are ideal for reminders, rules, or pinned info that shouldn’t get buried in chat.

### 📌 Example
```bash
/sticky embed create rules "Server Rules" "Please follow the guidelines listed above." #ffcc00
```
This will:
- Create a sticky embed named rules
- Store it with the given title, description, and color
- Allow you to send or manage it using the other sticky commands

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

🗃️ Notes
> - Sticky embeds are stored separately from normal embeds created with `/embed create`.
> - You’ll need to use `/sticky embed send` to place the sticky embed into a channel.
> - When active, Pandoryx will automatically re-post the embed to the bottom after other users send messages.
