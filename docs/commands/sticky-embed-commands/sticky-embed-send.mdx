# /sticky embed send

Send a sticky embed to a specific channel and activate it. Once sent, Pandoryx will automatically re-post the embed any time someone sends a message in that channel — keeping it “stuck” at the bottom.

### 💬 Usage
```bash
/sticky embed send <name> <channel>
```
- `<name>` – The name of the sticky embed you want to send.
- `<channel>` – The channel where the embed should be activated.
:::success
Sticky embeds are ideal for rules, reminders, or ongoing announcements in active channels.

### 📌 Example
```bash
/sticky embed send rules #general
```
This will:
- Post the rules sticky embed into the `#general` channel
- Re-post the embed automatically when new messages are sent, keeping it visible
- Run continuously until you remove it with `/sticky embed remove`

<hr className="md-divider-gradient" />

### 🗃️ Notes
> - Only one sticky embed can be active per channel.
> - If a sticky embed is already active in the selected channel, it will be replaced.
> - Pandoryx needs Manage Messages and Send Messages permissions in the channel to function correctly.
